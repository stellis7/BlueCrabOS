## Meet time
- Best to be on Wednesdays at 2100-2200
## Notes
- Can use confluence but not preferred
- More likely to use markdown
- Can use obsidian and use the /docs directory as a vault
## Todo
- **John:** needs to revert to test post progress and push to dev
- **Everyone:** get familiar with rust and start reading through the posts
# July 19th, 2023
## Notes
- Still need to finish post notes
- Realized that the test part of the "Barebones" section was not done, needs to be finished
- Still need to work on Rust knowledge

## Notes
- Everything is caught up to the "Testing" post as well as documentation
- Started to get better at Rust
- What are our end goals
    - Try to get interrupts done by summertime
    - Think of long term goals for the project
    - Maybe get all kernel components of a microkernel:
        - Basic IPC
        - Virtual Memory
        - Scheduling
- Figure out if we can meet up more frequently
- Try to do memory management ourselves
## Todos
- Look into interrupts:
    - CPU Exceptions
    - Double Faults
    - Hardware Interrupts
- Try to think of our own implementation of these topics
- Make sure to read the posts to see what he did
- **Proposed TODO**:
    - Split up into two teams:
        - Have two people work on implementing different synchronization primitives (spinlocks, mutex, semaphores)
        - Have the other three research and implement hardware interrupts
    - Hope to have some form of hardware interrupts and synchronization primitives by end of summer so we can tackle thread scheduling
